# S2I Builders Catalog
This Catalog contains various s2i builders that we are using at Alien6 when building Docker Images from sources.

## Source-To-Image (S2I)
### Overview
Source-to-Image (S2I) is a toolkit and workflow for building reproducible Docker images from source code. S2I produces
ready-to-run images by injecting source code into a Docker container and letting the container prepare that source code for execution. By creating self-assembling **builder images**, you can version and control your build environments exactly like you use Docker images to version your runtime environments.
